## Welcome :rocket:

I'm Elizabeth, a student currently honing my software development skills at CodeStack Academy. :seedling:

When I'm not crafting code, you'll find me at the gym, exploring the great outdoors, reading sci-fi/fantasy literature, or enjoying quality time with my golden retriever. :feet:

Let's connect, collaborate, and create something amazing together! ðŸ“«

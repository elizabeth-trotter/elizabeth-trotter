## Welcome <img src="https://github.com/et120/et120/assets/148283439/84790f56-e37a-4dde-9f32-52018624e65a" width="40" height="40"/>

#### Hi, I'm Elizabeth!

I completed a year-long intensive software development program, where I honed my skills in <strong>full stack development</strong>. While I've graduated, my <strong>passion for learning</strong> and exploring new technologies continues to grow. <img align=center src="https://github.com/et120/et120/assets/148283439/20527a1e-ce21-4764-a17a-05dd2650be66" width="24" height="24"/>

When I'm not <strong>crafting code</strong>, you'll find me at the gym, exploring the great outdoors, reading sci-fi/ fantasy literature, or enjoying quality time with my golden retriever. <img align=center src="https://github.com/et120/et120/assets/148283439/6958f36d-5287-4687-bae6-60c5715e3ba1" width="27" height="27"/>

Let's connect, collaborate, and <strong>create something amazing</strong> together!

## Welcome ðŸ‘‹

I'm Elizabeth, a student currently honing my software development skills at CodeStack Academy. 

When I'm not crafting code, you'll find me at the gym, exploring the great outdoors, reading sci-fi/fantasy literature, or enjoying quality time with my golden retriever. 

Let's connect, collaborate, and create something amazing together!
